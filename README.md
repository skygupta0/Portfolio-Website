<h1> Portfolio </h1>
<h2> A portfolio using HTML5, CSS3 & JavaScript!</h2>
What one can see in this project : <br>
- Simplicity <br>
- Modern UI <br>
- Pure CSS <br>
- Easy to understand <br>
- Fully Functional <br>
- Email service for contact/feedback <br>
- Smooth, easy and better UX <br>
- Mobile support (Android as well as IOS)<br>
- Custom navbar for mobile devices (Hamburger menu) <br><br>
For the email service I have used EmailJs as it can send Email Directly From JavaScript and there's no need for a server.<br>
